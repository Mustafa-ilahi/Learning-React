**** RN Cli VS Expo ****

RN CLI: (Permenant House)
 ==> PROS:
	1)Development is fast.
	2)We can link our Native code with RN CLI.
	3)You are opent to use vast collection of Libraries contributed by the developers.
	4) Build(apk/ipa) size is less usually.

  ==> CONS:
           1)We neeed more effort for this setup.
            Android: Android Studio (SDK)
            iOS: Xcode
           2)Less build errors
           3)External hardware related libraries need linking
	that's why difficult to integrate.
	4)You will need MAC for iOS development
	    *** Purchase MAC ***
	  (1)Hackintosh => It's a software that will make convert your windows into MAC)
	   (2) VMware)
	   (3) TeamViewer)
	5) Difficult to maintain.
EXPO : (Rent House)
 ==> PROS:
	1)We need very little effort for the setup. We Don't
	   need SDK installation before it's setup.
	2)Less build errors
                3)External hardware related libraries don't need linking
	   that's why easy to integrate.
	4)You don't need MAC for iOS development but for the final buid, you will
	    need MAC.
	5) Easy to maintain.

  ==> CONS:
	1)Development is little bit slow.
	2)We can't link our Native code with RN CLI.
	3)You are limited to Expo Libraries.
	4) Build(apk/ipa) size is more usually.

            longitude: 67.0872638,
